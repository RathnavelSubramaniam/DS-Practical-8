# DS-Practical-8
## 8.	Create a program with a superclass called Figure that defines a method called area( ) which computes the area of an object. Then derives two subclasses from Figure. The first is Rectangle and the second is Triangle. Each of these subclasses overrides area( ) so that it returns the area of a rectangle and a triangle, respectively

### file name : FindAreas.java

### Sample Output:

### Inside Area for Rectangle
### Area is 45.0
### Inside Area for Triangle
### Area is 40.0
### Area for Figure is undefined
### Area is 0.0
